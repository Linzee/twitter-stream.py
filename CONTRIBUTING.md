Any contributions should follow the following pattern:

* Make a feature or bugfix branch, e.g., git checkout -b my_new_feature
* Make your changes in that branch
* Ensure you bump the version number in setup.py to reflect your changes. We use Semantic Versioning, so non-breaking enhancements should increment the minor version, e.g., `1.5.0` -> `1.6.0`, and bugfixes will increment the last version, `1.6.0` -> `1.6.1`.
* Create a pull request
